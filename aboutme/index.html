    <h2>Hermann KPADONOU</h2>
    <p>I hold a technician's certificate in electronic and computer systems. <br>I am interested in new technologies and innovations. I currently work in a fintech as an IT support. <br>I am responsible for the maintenance of the platform and technical configurations, as well as the reporting of incidents and risks related to banking transactions. <br>I dream of becoming a web developer or software engineer to realize personal projects in the fields of agriculture and education. <br>I am always ready to learn new things and take on new challenges.</p>
    <p>I am married to a lovely wife, who is studying hospitality. We have a lovely 3-year-old daughter. <br>We live in Aboisso, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, near the border with Ghana.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about piano, cooking, volunteering, and farming. <br>To relax, I enjoy playing the piano, preparing traditional dishes for my family and friends, or volunteering to help those in need. <br>I am a sociable, dynamic, and optimistic person. I get along well with people and respect differences. <br>I believe in my abilities and values. I am motivated by my goals and vision.</p>
    <p>I am delighted to be with u in this new adventure.</p>
